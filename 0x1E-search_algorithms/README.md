# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Description
This project contains C programs implementing various search algorithms, including linear search, binary search, jump search, interpolation search, exponential search, advanced binary search, and linear and jump searches in linked lists. Each algorithm is implemented and analyzed in terms of time and space complexity.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the concept of search algorithms
- Implement and understand linear search
- Implement and understand binary search
- Apply different search algorithms depending on specific requirements
- Analyze the time and space complexity of different search algorithms

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a newline
- A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder
- Code must adhere to the Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Use of the `printf` function for standard library output
- Prototypes of all functions must be included in the header file `search_algos.h`
- Header files must have include guards
- Big O notation files must be named accordingly and follow a specific format

- 12. Jump search in a singly linked list: Implement jump search algorithm for singly linked list
- 13. Linear search in a skip list: Implement linear search algorithm for a skip list

## Usage
Each task contains a C file with the implementation and a corresponding main file for testing. Compile each program using the provided compilation command and execute to test the search algorithms.

## Credits
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program, in which search algorithms are taught and practiced extensively.
